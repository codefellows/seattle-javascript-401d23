### What is a Tree?

Trees are a widely used data structure that simulate a hierarchical "tree" structure. These data structures contain a **root**, which may or may not contain a series of child sub-trees. They can also be defined recursively as a collection of nodes, which starts at the root node and each node is a data structure consisting of a value and an array of references to any child nodes. Trees are also considered to be a directed, acyclic, connected graph.

### Breaking Down A Tree
  * **root:** - the top node in a tree
  * **child:** - a node that's a direct sub-tree of another node
  * **siblings:** - a group of nodes with the same parent
  * **leaf:** - a node with node children

### Useful Implementations of Trees**
  * the DOM
  * a computer file system
  * sorting and searching
